      C++: The Complete Reference
    </h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>If there is one language that defines modern programming, it is C++. Its syntax, style, and philosophy have set the standard by which all other languages are judged. Furthermore, C++ is the universal language of programming. When an algorithm or technique is described, it is usually done so using the C++ syntax. The long-term success of C++ has also left a lasting impression on computer language development. For example, both Java and C# are descended from C++. Frankly, to be a professional programmer implies proficiency in C++. It is the one language that no programmer can afford to ignore. This is the fourth edition of C++: The Complete Reference. It fully describes and demonstrates the keywords, syntax, functions, classes, and features that define the C++ language. More specifically, this book fully describes Standard C++. This is the version of C++ defined by the ANSI/ISO Standard for C++ and it is the version of C++ that is supported by all major compilers, including Microsoft’s Visual C++ and Borland’s C++ Builder. Thus, the information in this book is applicable to all modern programming environments.
